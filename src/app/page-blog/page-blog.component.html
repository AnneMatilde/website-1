        <p>Every writer that want to pass on some knowledge should build legitimacy by starting off by sharing something about themselfs or the team their a part of. I’ve chosen the latter one, Bjerk is a wonderful team that keeps evolving around technology. I believe that because we are eager to try something new, that we’ve become to successful. Being in the Nordic market, you need to showcase the very new stuff to keep elvoing – in my humble opition.</p>
        <p>Serverless technology has been a key-piece for us, because of it’s lightweight but solid fundation. We love to give other people the responsiblity of operations, so we can keep pushing the newest technology and ideas in what we’re best at – development. The very first time we met Serverless was back when we all worked at AYR, who later became the largest Google Partner in Norway. At that time we’d been using Amazon Web Services for a while, running EC2 for many years. We signed up to become partners with AWS (we never took the leap though). We were invited to this reseller introductory event, we attended eager to know more of how we could use all that technology. However, the peak of the whole introduction was the simple snack bar at the reseption. The AWS representative seemed not to know anything of the cool new technology called Serverless, but the slideshow he had, spoke to me – it spelled «Pay only for the milliseconds you use». I remember seing new opportunities to motive our crew to make more efficient code, like bonuses on how many percent we could spare on hosting.</p>
        <p>Six days into researching, I fell in love. Words like managed, auto-scaleable infrastructure … it was lovely. The stack became even more with API Gateway, the Serverless project. We soon became big users of Lambda, Serverless, DynamoDB</p>
        <p>We keep evolving, I’ll say.</p>
